    "title": "The primes of NBA players are changing… slightly",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A players prime is traditionally considered there late twentys and early thirties and then there is a decline in the late thirties. This understanding has never truly been argued with. But the NBA and there rules have changed that understanding. Back in the 1990s a traditionally a prospect entering the NBA draft played 3-4 years of college basketball. They were not so much drafted on potentil but drafted on production in college. Rookies were polished products ready expected to produce.\nBut attitudes and rules have changed. As the NBA style of play has become more skilled and isolation based the importance of potential skyrocketed. Prospects measurables and athletic ability became more important than their college production. Because of this top picks became younger and younger than years before.\nSo the question is has the mass wave of younger players entering the NBA changed when a players prime is?\nTo find this we’ll compare all players from the seasons 90-99 and 2012-2022. Each player is measured by something called a “McMasterScore”. The McMasterscore is found by this equation, McMasterScore = RBS/G * .05 + AST/G + PPG * TS% - TOV/G *2 + PER + DBPM + VORP. Essentially a McMasterscore values effecient scorers and defensive players. every player has been grouped by there age so each age has its own McMaster Score. By doing this we can find the prime age of NBA players and the different progressions between the 90s and 2010s. Quick thing to note, the 2010s first plotted line is at the age of 19 while the first plot for the 90s is at 22. The reason for this is because there were not an adequate enough 19, 20, and 21 year olds playing in the 90s to give an accurate number of their production\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\n\nyears <- 1980:2022\n\nalladvanced <- tibble()\n\nfor (i in years){\n\nurl <- paste0(\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_\", i, \"_advanced.html\")\n\nstats <- url %>% \n  read_html() %>% \n  html_nodes(xpath='//*[@id=\"advanced_stats\"]') %>%\n  html_table()\n\nstats <- stats[[1]] %>% select(-20, -25) %>% filter(Rk != \"Rk\") %>% mutate_at(6:27, as.numeric) %>% mutate(Rk=as.numeric(Rk), Age = as.numeric(Age)) %>% mutate(Season = i) %>% mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Player))\n\nalladvanced <- bind_rows(alladvanced, stats)\n\nSys.sleep(2)\n}\n\nyears <- 1980:2022\n\nallplayers <- tibble()\n\nfor (i in years){\n\nurl <- paste0(\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_\", i, \"_totals.html\")\n\nstats <- url %>% \n  read_html() %>% \n  html_nodes(xpath='//*[@id=\"totals_stats\"]') %>%\n  html_table()\n\nstats <- stats[[1]] %>% filter(Rk != \"Rk\") %>% mutate_at(6:30, as.numeric) %>% mutate(Rk=as.numeric(Rk), Age = as.numeric(Age)) %>% mutate(Season = i) %>% mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Player))\n\nallplayers <- bind_rows(allplayers, stats)\n\nSys.sleep(2)}\n\nallplayersallmetrics <- allplayers %>% inner_join(alladvanced)\n\nNineties <- allplayersallmetrics %>%  \n  filter(Season < 2000 & Season >= 1990) %>%  filter(G > 20)\n\nTwentyTens <- allplayersallmetrics %>%  \n  filter(Season < 2022 & Season >= 2012) %>%  filter(G > 20)\n\nTwentyTens <- allplayersallmetrics %>%  \n  filter(Season < 2022 & Season >= 2012) %>%  filter(G > 20)\n\nNineties <- allplayersallmetrics %>%  \n  filter(Season < 2000 & Season >= 1990) %>%  filter(G > 20)\n\nTwentyTensPerG <- TwentyTens %>% mutate(ASTPergame = AST/G) %>% mutate(TOVPergame = TOV/G) %>% mutate(PPG = PTS/G) %>% mutate( RBSPergame = TRB/G)\n\nNinetiesPerG <- Nineties %>% mutate(ASTPergame = AST/G) %>% mutate(TOVPergame = TOV/G) %>% mutate(PPG = PTS/G) %>% mutate( RBSPergame = TRB/G) %>% mutate(TS= PTS/2*(FGA + .44 * FTA))\n\nMMSCORE10s <- TwentyTensPerG %>% mutate(McMasterScore = RBSPergame *.05 + ASTPergame + PPG * `TS%` - TOVPergame *2 + PER + DBPM + VORP) %>%  arrange(desc(McMasterScore))\n\nMMSCORE90s <-NinetiesPerG %>%  mutate (McMasterScore = RBSPergame * .05 + ASTPergame + PPG * `TS%` - TOVPergame *2 + PER + DBPM + VORP) %>%  arrange(desc(McMasterScore))\n\nMMCharts10 <- MMSCORE10s %>% group_by(Age) %>% summarise(AvgScore = mean(McMasterScore))\n\nMMCharts90 <- MMSCORE90s %>% filter(Age >21 ) %>% group_by(Age) %>% summarise(AvgScore = mean(McMasterScore))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=MMCharts10, aes(x=Age, y=AvgScore), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_line(data=MMCharts90, aes(x=Age, y=AvgScore), color=\"blue\") + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Age of Player\", \n    y=\"McMaster Score\", \n    title=\"2010s NBA players prime vs 90s players prime\", \n    subtitle=\"2010s reach their primes quicker and it last longer but their peaks are the exact same\", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | Matt McMaster\"\n    ) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=21.8, y=20.5, label=\"2010s rise faster\"), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=28, y=18.5, label=\"Peak of Primes\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=28, y=17.7, label=\"are the same age\"), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=35.7, y=20.7, label=\"90s are better in early 30s\"), color=\"Blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=22, y=9, label=\"RED = 2010s\"), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=22, y=8, label=\"Blue = 90s\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  theme_light() + theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\"), \n     plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.title = element_text(size=18),\npanel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the line chart below we see that players in the 2010s start better but both groups of players hit their prime at the excact same age. Not only are the primes the same but the average McMaster Score between the two are seperated by only .16.The curious thinga about this is proximity in prime score. The 2010s understandbly dominate the early years because they have a three year head start.They are better all the way up to there prime but the 90s jump nearly a fully point from the age of 27 to 28. The 2010s only improve by .295 in the same time frame.this could be because of contracts. Some draft busts or not as good players don’t get contract extensions or get let go for younger players or after 6 years of NBA experience players make big leaps from 27-28.\nSecond thing to look at it is the length of primes. Players in the 2010s hit an average score of 20 quicker and hold it longer than players in the 90s. players in the 2010s reach an average score of 20 when they hit the age of 25 and don’t go under 20 until they’re 31. Players in the 90s hit an average score of 20 for the first time when they’re 27 and go back under when they’re 30. This is most likely has to do with the headstart 2010s players get over 90s players.\nThe final thing to look at is the early 30s portion of the graph. he 90s leave there prime around the age of 30 but pop back up from their decline at the age of 32. from ages 32-34 90s players are better than 2010s. Most likely this is where starting at 19 and 20 opposed to 21 and 22 bites the 2010s in the butt. while they are better early most likely due to wear and tear on the body they aren’t to stay as consistent when they leave their primes comapred to 90s players.\nSo we see that the best season of an NBA player comes at the age of 28. Now lets see how best players at the prime age of 28 and see how they compare to one another.\n\n\nCode\ntop10MS10 <- MMSCORE10s %>%  filter(Age == 28) %>% arrange(desc(McMasterScore)) %>% top_n(10, wt=McMasterScore)\n\n\ntop10MS90 <- MMSCORE90s %>%  filter(Age == 28) %>% arrange(desc(McMasterScore)) %>% top_n(10, wt=McMasterScore)\n\n\nChart10 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=top10MS10, aes(x=reorder(Player, McMasterScore), weight=McMasterScore)) + \n  coord_flip()\n\nLBJ <- top10MS10 %>% filter(Player == \"LeBron James\")\nDR <- top10MS90 %>% filter(Player == \"David Robinson\")\nMA <- top10MS90 %>% filter(Player == \"Michael Adams\")\nPE <- top10MS90 %>% filter(Player == \"Patrick Ewing\")\nKI <- top10MS10 %>% filter(Player == \"Kyrie Irving\")\n\n\nChart90 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=top10MS90, aes(x=reorder(Player, McMasterScore), weight=McMasterScore), fill = \"lightsteelblue4\") + \n  geom_bar(data=DR, aes(x=reorder(Player, McMasterScore), weight=McMasterScore),fill=\"Gray54\") +\n  geom_bar(data=MA, aes(x=reorder(Player, McMasterScore), weight=McMasterScore), fill = \"Yellow\")+\n  geom_bar(data=PE, aes(x=reorder(Player, McMasterScore), weight=McMasterScore),fill=\"DarkOrange2\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(title=\"The Best of 90s vs the Best of the 2010s\", subtitle = \"Who's the best at age 28?.\",  x=\"\", y=\"McMasterScore\", caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference | Matt McMaster\") + \n  theme_minimal() + theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\nChart10 <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=top10MS10, aes(x=reorder(Player, McMasterScore), weight=McMasterScore), fill = \"lightsteelblue4\") +\n  geom_bar(data=LBJ, aes(x=reorder(Player, McMasterScore), weight=McMasterScore), fill = \"Purple\") +\n  geom_bar(data=KI, aes(x=reorder(Player, McMasterScore), weight=McMasterScore), fill = \"Black\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(title=\"\", subtitle = \"\",  x=\"\", y=\"McMasterScore\", caption = \"\") + \n  theme_minimal() + theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\nplot_grid(Chart90, Chart10)\n\n\n\n\n\nLebron James and David Robinson are the best players at 28. James has a score of 62.74 edging out Robinson whose score is 62.05. The bottom two scores are Kyre Irving and Patrick Ewing. irving smokes Ewing by a score 45.72 to 41.6. Overall the 90s top ten averages a score of 47.7 compared to the 2010s whose top ten’s average is 52.18. the 90s best at 28 is nearly 4.5 points below the best of the 2010s yet their overall average is less than .2 below the 2010s overall average. This could indicate that the depth of the 90s is stronger than the 2010s.\nSide note, the player highlighted in yellow is Michael Adams. I had no clue who Mr.Adams was before this project and I owe him and apology. At the age of 28 in the 1990 season Michael Adams averaged 26.5 PPG 10 AST/G 3 RBS/G and had a TS% of 53. He’s the 7th best player at 28 in the 90s.\nSo the 2010s have a higher prime and there best players are better than the 90s. But how about the younger players? lets comapare the 22 year olds of 90s production to the 2010s.\n\n\nCode\nRookChart10 <- MMSCORE10s %>% filter(Age == 22) \n\nRookChart90 <- MMSCORE90s %>% filter(Age == 22) \n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=RookChart10, aes(x=MP, y=McMasterScore),color =\"Red\") +\n  geom_point(data=RookChart90, aes(x=MP, y=McMasterScore), color = \"Blue\") +\n  labs (x=\"Minutes played\", \n    y=\"McMaster Score\", \n    title=\"22 year olds vs 22 year olds\", \n    subtitle=\"Extra years of experience help the 2010s young players to be better\", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | Matt McMaster\"\n    ) + geom_text(aes(x=750, y=-2, label=\"low minute 90s rookie cluster\"), color=\"black\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=1500, y=45, label=\"More 10s High Producers\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2600, y=5, label=\"More inefficient production from 90s\"), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=300, y=50, label=\"90s = Blue\"), color=\"black\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=300, y=45, label=\"2010s = Red\"), color=\"black\") +\n  theme_light() + theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\"), \n     plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.title = element_text(size=18),\npanel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nClearly there is a cluster of 90s players at the bottom. Thats because so many of them are rookies. Because most of the 22 years olds have been playing in the league for a 2 maybe 3 years before they’re 22 there are less of them in the low minute low production part of the graph. So there are more higher production 22 years olds in the 2010s than the 90s. Younger players are better now than 20-30 years ago. What this indicates is development through the league is more effective than becoming a more polished product in college\nWhat’s incredible is that the last two charts have proved that younger players are better today than decades ago and the best now are better than the best then But at the end of the day both groups of players are there best at the same time and produce nearly the same. After looking at all the data I can conclude a couple of things. First the primes of NBA players are different. 2010s have there best years from 25-30. 90s players have there best years from 27-33. Secondly overall 2010s players are very very slightly better than 90s players. The 2010s score higher in nearly all years besides there mid 30s but not by to much. But the most curious thing is that the best year of NBA player is when they’re 28. Not only do they peak at the same time but the peak is basically the same. paths to the same treasure. But what can be concluded is that the early development of players has affected there production based on age and our perception of age when evaluating these players should change as well."

    "text": "The finding below used the same score to measure players performance. Players were grouped into ages and separated from ages based on what position they play whether it be PG, SG, SF, PF, or C. The 1990s, 2000s and 2010s have all been separated into their own Below are multiple graphs that show. These graphs show not only what positions were better and hence more valuable to have in each era but also how their value changed over time. You will see that positions that performed in the 90s were not as good in the 2000s or 2010s and vice versa. This project also delves into how different positions aged. And answers the questions How bad did some positions play at the end of their careers and also shows surprisingly that some positions held value in their later

These graphs show us a lot about each positions performance in a given era compared to another and when when broken down individually you can put all the information together to figure out how the game of basketball has changed from 1990-2020.\nPSA: The term “from age 28-35” is used as a measuring stick for total position performance. The reason for this is the prime year of a position on average is 28 years old and their decline occurs to at the latest (if they’re still in the league) 35. 35 is the cutoff I used to measure players because when players turn 36 there just aren’t enough players to get an accurate reading on a position performs\n1990s: The 90s were dominated by point guards. Gary Payton, John Stockton, Derrick Harper and Mark price led the way for the point guards through a majority of the 90s. Its not surprising to see that Point guards did so well in this era considering how many assist they had. McMasterScore values efficient scoring but also vlaues assists heavily. In the 90s PGs overall averaged more assists than the 90s and the 2000s. 90s PGs from the age 28-35 averaged 4.77 AST/G 2000s PGs averaged 4.12 2010s average 4.22. Also wing positions failed to created nearly as much as point guards as SFs from ages 28-35 averaged under 2 assist per game and SGs during the same span averaged 2.5 AST/G. PFs were consistent during the 90s and show the most linear rise and fall of any position. Centers had it rough, which is surprising considering how much more important paint presence was in that era of basketball. Also You might be wondering “wow those dips and sudden rises by SFs and SGs are weird.” Well that’s thanks to two players, Larry Bird and Michael Jordan. There are only so many players at each position. As age goes up the number of players at each position goes down so the average McMasterScore can be very volatile and one players presence or absence can greatly effect a score. That’s exactly what happened with Larry Bird and MJ. The the years, 33-35 where SFs average score skyrockets, are the 3 years Larry Bird played in the 90s. And SGs peak then dip then peak again are thank to Michael Jordan trying to become a baseball player. But still Wing players had a good decade as SGs and SFs were the two top scoring positions with 11 and 11.6 PPG respectfully. Overall the 90s were volatile time controlled by PGs unselfishness and supplemented by wings unrivaled scoring ability\n2000s:The 2000s is the most interesting year. There are volatile peaks and plummets year to year by nearly every position but there is so much parity. 4 positions at one point held the top spot for average McMasterScore. Point guards fell off from the 90s to the 2000s. Not only did PGs have less assist but they also scored less points. shooting guards led all scorers with small forwards right behind them. Centers had another tough year as they were overall more used for defense than to produce high volume and efficient offensive numbers. PFs did much better in the 2000s than in the 1990s. At one point PFs had the highest Average McMasterScore something that had not been reach in the 90s. The PFs average McMaster score in the 2000s was 18.9. in the 90s it was 17.2. The reason for this is the increase of star power forwards. The 90s PF were dominated by Hall of Famers Charles Barkley and Karl Malone who traded best average McMasterScore back and forth. But after them the position was chalked full of hall of very good players like Horace Grant and Larry Nance. The 2000s however were chalked full of superstar powerf orwards such as Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzski, Tim Duncan, and Chris Weber. Players like Shawn Marion and Rasheed Wallace also contributed to the positions rise in the 2000s.\n2010s: Welcome the parties centers!! Centers, who were in the basement for twenty years, not only showed up but dominated early years. Centers developed the quickest out of any position in the 2010s. From ages 20-25 held the highest average score and were carried by young stars such as Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Demarcus Cousins, Joel Embiid, Rudy Gobert, Nikola Jokic, and Dwight Howards Age 25 Season. Centers in the 2010s from Ages 28-35 averaged more points and rebounds than 2000s centers. Point guards reestablished their dominance in the 2010s. 2010s point guards from age 28-35 averaged more points assist and rebounds per game than the 2000s. Centers were allowed to use there size and strength more to have a greater contribution on offense. 2010s basketball was less emphatic on defense and more about fast paced offense. Fast paced offenses benefit distributors and shooters which is why shooting guards and PGs had such a great decade and why small forwards and power forwards who typically are not elite at either found themselves in the basement most of the decade.\nSo we’ve seen the overall progress of each position in each era. We have seen how they have all individually progressed through the years but how are far do they all compareitively fall in their career?

First the major Point guard dropoff. First we’ll address the major dropoff of 2010s point guards in the graph below. But it is something to note because it was not the only time a position went from best to worse on this graph. Power Forwards and Shooting guards both increased from their prime to their age 35 season. This happened because of data. there aren’t a lot of players who play in the NBA at the age of 35 so superstars can completely skew the data. Power forwards have a better score at 35 than 28 thanks to Dirk Nowitzski and Small Forwards are way higher at 35 than 28 because of hall of famers Ray Allen, Dwyane Wade, and Manu Ginobli. While this flaw may not accurately depict how positions decline it shows the value of having superstars on your team. If you are able to get superstars not only are they incredible in their prime but they can play for a long time at a high level.\n2000s: Very consistent year. 4 Positions are all fairly close to one another in peaks and 4 positions are all very close to each other where they end there decline but its not all perfect. Centers went up from 28 to 35 based on the reasons we discussed earlier, we can thank David Robinson and Shaquille O’Neal. But once again we have massive dip from top of the mountain to the sewers. Small Forwards took a MASSIVE dip from 28 to 35 due to lack of players. 10 SF made it to be 35 year old SFs in the 2000s and the ones who were playing were could not get above single digit McMasterScores.\n1990s: We see we have yet another increase from 35 to 28. Like I mentioned above this is due to the insane play of Larry Bird at such an old age. Other than that a very consistent decade overall. Guards dominated the decade and peaked and declined at a similar rate while doing very different jobs on the court. And powerforwards and centers were very comparable as well which should be no surprise considering that they play similar positions\nTo conclude there were two unique things to note from this. First twice did a position go from being the best at 28 to being the worst at 35. The reasons could be attributed to high loads. Small forwards in the 2000s and PGs in the 10s were the best of their decade and were counted on to do a lot. this increased load caused many to reitre and the ones who didn’t could not continue to perform at a high level. Also other than cases where a hall of fame player playing at a ridiculous high level skewed the graph results were consistent. Positions had a steady decline but were still better than positions they had hire peaks than.\nSo throughout the the project we’ve seen one position dominate, the point guard, and one position suffer, the center. The next graph compares the two’s prime year of 28 and where they ended up at 35.\n\n\nCode\nPeak28 <- PeaksAndValley %>% filter(AGE == \"28\")\n\n\n\n\nPeak35 <- PeaksAndValley %>% filter(AGE == \"35\")\n\n\n\nBarPeak35 <-Peak35 %>% filter(Pos == \"90sPG\" | Pos == \"90sC\" | Pos == \"2010sC\" | Pos == \"2010sPG\" | Pos == \"2000sPG\" | Pos == \"2000sC\") %>% arrange(desc(McMasterScore))\n\n\n\nBarPeak28 <- Peak28 %>% filter(Pos == \"90sPG\" | Pos == \"90sC\" | Pos == \"2010sC\" | Pos == \"2010sPG\" | Pos == \"2000sPG\" | Pos == \"2000sC\") %>% arrange(desc(McMasterScore))\n\n\n\nPGOLD2010s <- BarPeak35 %>% filter(Pos == \"2010sPG\")\nPGPEAK2010s <- BarPeak28 %>% filter(Pos == \"2010sPG\")\n\nBarNew <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=BarPeak28, aes(x=reorder(Pos, McMasterScore), weight=McMasterScore), fill = \"dodgerblue4\") + \n  geom_bar(data=PGPEAK2010s, aes(x=reorder(Pos, McMasterScore), weight=McMasterScore), fill = \"darkolivegreen4\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(title=\"Centers Progression vs Point Guard Progression\", subtitle = \"PGs Play Better But Age Worse\",  x=\"McMasterScore\", y=\"Age\", caption = \"\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\"), \n     plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.title = element_text(size=10),\npanel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\nBarOld <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=BarPeak35, aes(x=reorder(Pos, McMasterScore), weight=McMasterScore), fill = \"dodgerblue4\") + \n  geom_bar(data=PGOLD2010s, aes(x=reorder(Pos, McMasterScore), weight=McMasterScore), fill = \"darkolivegreen4\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(title=\"\", subtitle = \"\",  x=\"McMasterScore\", y=\"Age\", caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference | Matt McMaster\") + \n  theme_minimal() +theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\"), \n     plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.title = element_text(size=10),\npanel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\nplot_grid(BarNew, BarOld)\n\n\n\n\n\nSo no surprise here the point guard dominates the center in peak age coming in at 1, 2, and 3 out of 6. Like I mentioned earlier, McMasterScore benefits those who have the ball and benefits those who are efficient with it even more. Unless you were a hall of famer like Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O’Neal or David Robinson, centers did not make an impact on the offensive end in the 90s or 2000s. If McMasterScore was a defensive dominant statistic the case would be opposite. But what is the most surprising thing about this graph is the massive decline of 2010s point guards. They plummet which is strange considering Point Guards have dominated nearly every graph we’ve looked at. My guess is , wear and tear. Point guards hold the ball a lot in order to command an offense. The game of basketball has only gotten faster and point guards have a very taxing load to deal with on offense. Also when you consider the fact that they became more of a scoring threat in the 2010s and cannot use physical strength due to their lack of size, it makes sense why older point can’t compete in modern basketball.\nTo conclude basketball changed a little bit. The most noteworthy thing is th importance of point guards. At nearly every chart shown point guards were near the top. The importance of a team to have a player who can command an offense and control a game will matter in basketball not matter how the game evolves. Point guards are essential to teams success and were vital in every decade. While point guards stayed relevant, small forwards and power forwards were left behind. Basketball is still changing to a more skill based, fast pace game. Players who are elite at play making, user their dominant size and/or shooting ability are thriving in basketball. Forwards do not have that build. Small Forwards are athletic and good shooters but typically aren’t as fast as point guards and aren’t as effective shooters and SGs. Power Forwards art big and physical but not as big and physical as centers. Both positions are tweeners who’s main skillets don’t fit into the type of game basketball is turning into and is falling into the backseat of importance because of it."

Players were grouped into ages and separated from ages based on what position they play whether it be PG, SG, SF, PF, or C. The 1990s, 2000s and 2010s have all been separated into their own Below are multiple graphs that show. These graphs show not only what positions were better and hence more valuable to have in each era but also how their value changed over time. You will see that positions that performed in the 90s were not as good in the 2000s or 2010s and vice versa. This project also delves into how different positions aged. And answers the questions How bad did some positions play at the end of their careers and also shows surprisingly that some positions held value in their later years.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\n\nyears <- 1980:2022\n\nalladvanced <- tibble()\n\nfor (i in years){\n\nurl <-

These graphs show us a lot about each positions performance in a given era compared to another and when when broken down individually you can put all the information together to figure out how the game of basketball has changed from 1990-2020.\nPSA: The term “from age 28-35” is used as a measuring stick for total position performance. The reason for this is the prime year of a position on average is 28 years old and their decline occurs to at the latest (if they’re still in the league) 35. 35 is the cutoff I used to measure players because when players turn 36 there just aren’t enough players to get an accurate reading on a position performs\n1990s: The 90s were dominated by point guards. Gary Payton, John Stockton, Derrick Harper and Mark price led the way for the point guards through a majority of the 90s. Its not surprising to see that Point guards did so well in this era considering how many assist they had. McMasterScore values efficient scoring but also vlaues assists heavily. In the 90s PGs overall averaged more assists than the 90s and the 2000s. 90s PGs from the age 28-35 averaged 4.77 AST/G 2000s PGs averaged 4.12 2010s average 4.22. Also wing positions failed to created nearly as much as point guards as SFs from ages 28-35 averaged under 2 assist per game and SGs during the same span averaged 2.5 AST/G. PFs were consistent during the 90s and show the most linear rise and fall of any position. Centers had it rough, which is surprising considering how much more important paint presence was in that era of basketball. Also You might be wondering “wow those dips and sudden rises by SFs and SGs are weird.” Well that’s thanks to two players, Larry Bird and Michael Jordan. There are only so many players at each position. As age goes up the number of players at each position goes down so the average McMasterScore can be very volatile and one players presence or absence can greatly effect a score. That’s exactly what happened with Larry Bird and MJ. The the years, 33-35 where SFs average score skyrockets, are the 3 years Larry Bird played in the 90s. And SGs peak then dip then peak again are thank to Michael Jordan trying to become a baseball player. But still Wing players had a good decade as SGs and SFs were the two top scoring positions with 11 and 11.6 PPG respectfully. Overall the 90s were volatile time controlled by PGs unselfishness and supplemented by wings unrivaled scoring ability\n2000s:The 2000s is the most interesting year. There are volatile peaks and plummets year to year by nearly every position but there is so much parity. 4 positions at one point held the top spot for average McMasterScore. Point guards fell off from the 90s to the 2000s. Not only did PGs have less assist but they also scored less points. shooting guards led all scorers with small forwards right behind them. Centers had another tough year as they were overall more used for defense than to produce high volume and efficient offensive numbers. PFs did much better in the 2000s than in the 1990s. At one point PFs had the highest Average McMasterScore something that had not been reach in the 90s. The PFs average McMaster score in the 2000s was 18.9. in the 90s it was 17.2. The reason for this is the increase of star power forwards. The 90s PF were dominated by Hall of Famers Charles Barkley and Karl Malone who traded best average McMasterScore back and forth. But after them the position was chalked full of hall of very good players like Horace Grant and Larry Nance. The 2000s however were chalked full of superstar powerf orwards such as Kevin Garnett, Dirk Nowitzski, Tim Duncan, and Chris Weber. Players like Shawn Marion and Rasheed Wallace also contributed to the positions rise in the 2000s.\n2010s: Welcome the parties centers!! Centers, who were in the basement for twenty years, not only showed up but dominated early years. Centers developed the quickest out of any position in the 2010s. From ages 20-25 held the highest average score and were carried by young stars such as Karl Anthony Towns, Anthony Davis, Demarcus Cousins, Joel Embiid, Rudy Gobert, Nikola Jokic, and Dwight Howards Age 25 Season. Centers in the 2010s from Ages 28-35 averaged more points and rebounds than 2000s centers. Point guards reestablished their dominance in the 2010s. 2010s point guards from age 28-35 averaged more points assist and rebounds per game than the 2000s. Centers were allowed to use there size and strength more to have a greater contribution on offense. 2010s basketball was less emphatic on defense and more about fast paced offense. Fast paced offenses benefit distributors and shooters which is why shooting guards and PGs had such a great decade and why small forwards and power forwards who typically are not elite at either found themselves in the basement most of the decade.\nSo we’ve seen the overall progress of each position in each era. We have seen how they have all individually progressed through the years but how are far do they all compareitively fall in their career? The graph below shows positions scores at the age of 28 (The average prime year of their careers) compared to\n\n\nCode\nPeaksAndValley <- read.csv(\"SPMC350Project2File - Sheet1.csv\")\n\nSC90PG <-

First the major Point guard dropoff. First we’ll address the major dropoff of 2010s point guards in the graph below. But it is something to note because it was not the only time a position went from best to worse on this graph. Power Forwards and Shooting guards both increased from their prime to their age 35 season. This happened because of data. there aren’t a lot of players who play in the NBA at the age of 35 so superstars can completely skew the data. Power forwards have a better score at 35 than 28 thanks to Dirk Nowitzski and Small Forwards are way higher at 35 than 28 because of hall of famers Ray Allen, Dwyane Wade, and Manu Ginobli. While this flaw may not accurately depict how positions decline it shows the value of having superstars on your team. If you are able to get superstars not only are they incredible in their prime but they can play for a long time at a high level.\n2000s: Very consistent year. 4 Positions are all fairly close to one another in peaks and 4 positions are all very close to each other where they end there decline but its not all perfect. Centers went up from 28 to 35 based on the reasons we discussed earlier, we can thank David Robinson and Shaquille O’Neal. But once again we have massive dip from top of the mountain to the sewers. Small Forwards took a MASSIVE dip from 28 to 35 due to lack of players. 10 SF made it to be 35 year old SFs in the 2000s and the ones who were playing were could not get above single digit McMasterScores.\n1990s: We see we have yet another increase from 35 to 28. Like I mentioned above this is due to the insane play of Larry Bird at such an old age. Other than that a very consistent decade overall. Guards dominated the decade and peaked and declined at a similar rate while doing very different jobs on the court. And powerforwards and centers were very comparable as well which should be no surprise considering that they play similar positions\nTo conclude there were two unique things to note from this. First twice did a position go from being the best at 28 to being the worst at 35. The reasons could be attributed to high loads. Small forwards in the 2000s and PGs in the 10s were the best of their decade and were counted on to do a lot. this increased load caused many to reitre and the ones who didn’t could not continue to perform at a high level. Also other than cases where a hall of fame player playing at a ridiculous high level skewed the graph results were consistent. Positions had a steady decline but were still better than positions they had hire peaks than.\nSo throughout the the project we’ve seen one position dominate, the point guard, and one position suffer, the center. The next graph compares the two’s prime year of 28 and where they ended up at 35.\n\n\nCode\nPeak28 <- PeaksAndValley %>% filter(AGE == \"28\")\n\n\n\n\nPeak35 <- PeaksAndValley %>% filter(AGE == \"35\")\n\n\n\nBarPeak35 <-Peak35 %>% filter(Pos == \"90sPG\" | Pos == \"90sC\" | Pos == \"2010sC\" | Pos == \"2010sPG\" | Pos == \"2000sPG\" | Pos == \"2000sC\") %>% arrange(desc(McMasterScore))\n\n\n\nBarPeak28 <- Peak28 %>% filter(Pos == \"90sPG\" | Pos == \"90sC\" | Pos == \"2010sC\" | Pos == \"2010sPG\" | Pos == \"2000sPG\" | Pos == \"2000sC\") %>% arrange(desc(McMasterScore))\n\n\n\nPGOLD2010s <- BarPeak35 %>% filter(Pos == \"2010sPG\")\nPGPEAK2010s <- BarPeak28 %>% filter(Pos == \"2010sPG\")\n\nBarNew <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=BarPeak28, aes(x=reorder(Pos, McMasterScore), weight=McMasterScore), fill = \"dodgerblue4\") + \n  geom_bar(data=PGPEAK2010s, aes(x=reorder(Pos, McMasterScore), weight=McMasterScore), fill = \"darkolivegreen4\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(title=\"Centers Progression vs Point Guard Progression\", subtitle = \"PGs Play Better But Age Worse\",  x=\"McMasterScore\", y=\"Age\", caption = \"\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\"), \n     plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.title = element_text(size=10),\npanel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\nBarOld <- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=BarPeak35, aes(x=reorder(Pos, McMasterScore), weight=McMasterScore), fill = \"dodgerblue4\") + \n  geom_bar(data=PGOLD2010s, aes(x=reorder(Pos, McMasterScore), weight=McMasterScore), fill = \"darkolivegreen4\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(title=\"\", subtitle = \"\",  x=\"McMasterScore\", y=\"Age\", caption = \"Source: Basketball Reference | Matt McMaster\") + \n  theme_minimal() +theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size=16, face = \"bold\"), \n     plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.title = element_text(size=10),\npanel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\nplot_grid(BarNew, BarOld)\n\n\n\n\n\nSo no surprise here the point guard dominates the center in peak age coming in at 1, 2, and 3 out of 6. Like I mentioned earlier, McMasterScore benefits those who have the ball and benefits those who are efficient with it even more. Unless you were a hall of famer like Hakeem Olajuwon, Shaquille O’Neal or David Robinson, centers did not make an impact on the offensive end in the 90s or 2000s. If McMasterScore was a defensive dominant statistic the case would be opposite. But what is the most surprising thing about this graph is the massive decline of 2010s point guards. They plummet which is strange considering Point Guards have dominated nearly every graph we’ve looked at. My guess is , wear and tear. Point guards hold the ball a lot in order to command an offense. The game of basketball has only gotten faster and point guards have a very taxing load to deal with on offense. Also when you consider the fact that they became more of a scoring threat in the 2010s and cannot use physical strength due to their lack of size, it makes sense why older point can’t compete in modern basketball.\nTo conclude basketball changed a little bit. The most noteworthy thing is th importance of point guards. At nearly every chart shown point guards were near the top. The importance of a team to have a player who can command an offense and control a game will matter in basketball not matter how the game evolves. Point guards are essential to teams success and were vital in every decade. While point guards stayed relevant, small forwards and power forwards were left behind. Basketball is still changing to a more skill based, fast pace game. Players who are elite at play making, user their dominant size and/or shooting ability are thriving in basketball. Forwards do not have that build. Small Forwards are athletic and good shooters but typically aren’t as fast as point guards and aren’t as effective shooters and SGs. Power Forwards art big and physical but not as big and physical as centers. Both positions are tweeners who’s main skillets don’t fit into the type of game basketball is turning into and is falling into the backseat of importance because of it."
