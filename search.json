    "text": "A players prime is traditionally considered there late twentys and early thirties and then there is a decline in the late thirties. This understanding has never truly been argued with. But the NBA and there rules have changed that understanding. Back in the 1990s a prospect entering the NBA draft played 3-4 years of college basketball. They were not so much drafted on potentil but drafted on production in college. Rookies were polished products ready expected to produce.\nBut attitudes and rules have changed. As the NBA style of play has become more skilled and isolation based the importance of potential skyrocketed. Prospects measurables and athletic ability became more important than their college production. Because of this top picks became younger and younger than years before. Below is a heat chart of the age of draft picks over the last 30 years\nSo the question is has the mass wave of younger players entering the NBA changed when a players prime is?\nTo find this we’ll compare all players from the seasons 90-99 and 2012-2022. Each player is measured by something called a “McMasterScore”. The McMasterscore is found by this equation, McMasterScore = RBS/G * .05 + AST/G + PPG * TS% - TOV/G *2 + PER + DBPM + VORP. Essentially a McMasterscore values effecient scorers and defensive players. every player has been grouped by there age so each age has its own McMaster Score. By doing this we can find the prime age of NBA players and the different progressions between the 90s and 2010s.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.3.6     ✔ purrr   0.3.4\n✔ tibble  3.1.8     ✔ dplyr   1.0.9\n✔ tidyr   1.2.0     ✔ stringr 1.4.1\n✔ readr   2.1.2     ✔ forcats 0.5.2\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(rvest)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'rvest'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    guess_encoding\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\n\nyears <- 1980:2022\n\nalladvanced <- tibble()\n\nfor (i in years){\n\nurl <- paste0(\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_\", i, \"_advanced.html\")\n\nstats <- url %>% \n  read_html() %>% \n  html_nodes(xpath='//*[@id=\"advanced_stats\"]') %>%\n  html_table()\n\nstats <- stats[[1]] %>% select(-20, -25) %>% filter(Rk != \"Rk\") %>% mutate_at(6:27, as.numeric) %>% mutate(Rk=as.numeric(Rk), Age = as.numeric(Age)) %>% mutate(Season = i) %>% mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Player))\n\nalladvanced <- bind_rows(alladvanced, stats)\n\nSys.sleep(2)\n}\n\nyears <- 1980:2022\n\nallplayers <- tibble()\n\nfor (i in years){\n\nurl <- paste0(\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_\", i, \"_totals.html\")\n\nstats <- url %>% \n  read_html() %>% \n  html_nodes(xpath='//*[@id=\"totals_stats\"]') %>%\n  html_table()\n\nstats <- stats[[1]] %>% filter(Rk != \"Rk\") %>% mutate_at(6:30, as.numeric) %>% mutate(Rk=as.numeric(Rk), Age = as.numeric(Age)) %>% mutate(Season = i) %>% mutate(Player = gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Player))\n\nallplayers <- bind_rows(allplayers, stats)\n\nSys.sleep(2)}\n\nallplayersallmetrics <- allplayers %>% inner_join(alladvanced)\n\n\nJoining, by = c(\"Rk\", \"Player\", \"Pos\", \"Age\", \"Tm\", \"G\", \"MP\", \"Season\")\n\n\nCode\nNineties <- allplayersallmetrics %>%  \n  filter(Season < 2000 & Season >= 1990) %>%  filter(G > 20)\n\nTwentyTens <- allplayersallmetrics %>%  \n  filter(Season < 2022 & Season >= 2012) %>%  filter(G > 20)\n\nTwentyTens <- allplayersallmetrics %>%  \n  filter(Season < 2022 & Season >= 2012) %>%  filter(G > 20)\n\nNineties <- allplayersallmetrics %>%  \n  filter(Season < 2000 & Season >= 1990) %>%  filter(G > 20)\n\nTwentyTensPerG <- TwentyTens %>% mutate(ASTPergame = AST/G) %>% mutate(TOVPergame = TOV/G) %>% mutate(PPG = PTS/G) %>% mutate( RBSPergame = TRB/G)\n\nNinetiesPerG <- Nineties %>% mutate(ASTPergame = AST/G) %>% mutate(TOVPergame = TOV/G) %>% mutate(PPG = PTS/G) %>% mutate( RBSPergame = TRB/G) %>% mutate(TS= PTS/2*(FGA + .44 * FTA))\n\nMMSCORE10s <- TwentyTensPerG %>% mutate(McMasterScore = RBSPergame *.05 + ASTPergame + PPG * `TS%` -
